    "\n",
    "This notebook is both the protocol (described as numbered steps) and template python code for completing those steps. Copy this notebook into the data pipeline responsible for producing the data product (in the case of SNAP-produced datasets) or other location being used for curation of an external dataset. Currently, this notebook only covers a few classes of data that are commonly produced/consumed within SNAP's routine activities.\n",
